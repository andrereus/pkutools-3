# PKU Tools

PKU Tools is an All-in-One Nutrition App for PKU — a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help people with Phenylketonuria manage their low-phenylalanine diet. It combines a scale, nutritional table, calculator, pencil and paper into a single, easy-to-use application.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **✨ AI Calculator**: Describe or photograph your food and let AI estimate the weight and nutritional values
- **🔍 Food Search**: USDA-based food database with fuzzy search (multilingual support)
- **📷 Barcode Scanner**: Scan product barcodes to lookup nutritional information
- **📱 Phe Calculator**: Calculate Phe or convert protein to Phe (with conversion factors for fruit, vegetables, meat, and other foods)
- **📅 Diary**: Daily food log with date navigation, progress bars, and smart suggestions based on eating history
- **📖 Diet Report**: Charts and sortable tables of dietary patterns over time, plus a summary card with 14-day average Phe intake and deviation from your daily limit (CSV export)
- **📈 Blood Values**: Track and visualize Phe and tyrosine lab results with interactive charts (export as CSV, SVG, or PNG)
- **🍎 Own & Community Foods**: Save custom food entries with icon selection (included in search) and share with the PKU community (voting and quality control)

### User Experience

- **🌍 Multi-language Support**: English, German, Spanish, and French with localized routes
- **📱 PWA Support**: Installable as native app (also available as TWA on Google Play Store)
- **🔄 Real-time Sync**: Data syncs across devices via Firebase Realtime Database
- **🌓 Dark Mode**: Automatic based on system preferences with manual override

## Project History

PKU Tools has undergone significant refactoring over its versions:

- **Version 1**: Built with Vue 2, Options API, Vuetify, and Vuex
- **Version 2**: Refactored to Vue 3, Composition API, Tailwind CSS, and Pinia
- **Version 3** (current): Refactored to Nuxt 4 to improve performance, SEO, and developer experience

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 10+
- Infisical CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install Firebase CLI globally:

```bash
pnpm add -g firebase-tools
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Log in to Infisical (required for `pnpm dev`, which runs `infisical run -- nuxt dev`):

```bash
infisical login
```

The workspace is configured in `.infisical.json`. Environment variables are injected at runtime — no local `.env` file is needed for development.

**Note**: For local development with Firebase emulators, real Firebase credentials are not required. The app works with emulators even if Infisical values are empty or placeholders. Real credentials are only required for production deployment or when connecting to a real Firebase project.

## Development

### Firebase Emulators

Start emulators with data persistence (no Firebase config needed for local dev):

```bash
pnpm emulators:data
```

**Important**: Always use `Ctrl+C` to stop emulators and preserve data. Emulator UI at `http://localhost:4000`.

**Troubleshooting**: If ports are stuck, force-kill: `lsof -ti:9099,9000,4000 | xargs kill -9` (ports: 9099=Auth, 9000=Database, 4000=UI)

### Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

App available at `http://localhost:3000` (automatically connects to Firebase emulators).

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Development server
- `pnpm build` - Production build
- `pnpm emulators` - Firebase emulators (no data persistence)
- `pnpm emulators:data` - Firebase emulators with data persistence
- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix` - Linting
- `pnpm format:check` / `pnpm format` - Check/format code

## Quality Assurance

- ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript for code quality
- Test on multiple devices/browsers (including PWA installation)
- Add translations for new strings in all locale files (en, de, es, fr)
- Analytics: PostHog (respects cookie consent), Umami (privacy analytics)
- Dependency management: Dependabot notifications, manual updates via `pnpm outdated`, `pnpm update`, `pnpm audit`

## Production

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Production Deployment

**Firebase Setup:**

- Realtime Database enabled
- Authentication (Google + Email/Password)
- Database rules configured (`database.rules.json`)

**Firebase Admin SDK** (for server-side operations):

- Get service account JSON from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts
- Set environment variables:
  - `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID` (from `project_id`)
  - `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL` (from `client_email`)
  - `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY` (from `private_key`, include full key with headers)

**Note**: Admin SDK credentials not needed for local emulator development.

**Client-Side Firebase** (for production): Set environment variables as shown in `.env.example`.

**Note**: Client-side Firebase config not needed for local emulator development.

**License Keys** (for server-side validation):

- `PKU_TOOLS_LICENSE_KEY` - Premium license validation
- `PKU_TOOLS_LICENSE_KEY_2` - Premium license validation (also enables premium AI features)

Both keys are server-side only, never exposed to client.

**Deploy to Vercel:**

1. Connect repository
2. Add environment variables (see `.env.example` for all required variables)
3. Deploy (automatic on push to main)

## Architecture

**State Management**: Pinia store manages authentication, Gemini Developer API, and read-only state (diary entries, lab values, custom foods, settings) via Realtime Database.

**Data Flow**:

- Reads: Firebase Realtime Database listeners for instant sync across devices
- Writes: Nuxt server routes with Firebase Admin SDK for security and validation (Zod schemas)

**Server API**: All write operations require Firebase ID token authentication, validate with Zod schemas, and handle license validation server-side.

**Food Database**: Static JSON (`/public/data/usda-phe-kcal.json`) with USDA data, multilingual names (en, de, es, fr), and icons. User custom foods stored in Firebase and merged during search.

**Database Creation**: The food database combines two USDA database exports (phenylalanine values and calorie values) using an AI workflow to match appropriate icons to food items. Translations were added via Google Docs, and the data is converted from CSV to JSON format.

## Additional Information

- **i18n**: 4 languages (en, de, es, fr) with localized routes, content, dates, and charts
- **PWA**: Installable on mobile/desktop, TWA on Google Play, safe area support, mobile-first design
- **Privacy**: Health data consent (GDPR), cookie consent for analytics, consent history tracking
- **License**: Freemium model (limited free tier, premium with license key). Server-side validation only.
